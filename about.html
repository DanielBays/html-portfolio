<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a curious and driven learner actively building my skills to become a
  fullstack developer, with a strong foundation in understanding how technology
  solves real-world problems. My background in implementing and configuring
  complex SaaS platforms has given me firsthand insight into system
  architecture, user experience, and the importance of clean, maintainable
  code—both on the frontend and behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
  Currently, I am immersed in expanding my technical abilities through
  structured learning and hands-on projects. I am gaining proficiency in HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL, while exploring concepts like REST
  APIs, database design, and version control with Git. My experience writing
  HTML/CSS for client interfaces and working with SQL-based systems provides a
  practical bridge as I deepen my knowledge of fullstack development.
</p>

<p>
  What excites me most about this journey is the opportunity to not only build
  visually engaging interfaces but also to engineer the logic, data flow, and
  performance that power them. My prior roles in requirements analysis, client
  consultation, and system configuration have honed my ability to think
  critically, communicate clearly, and iterate based on feedback—skills I carry
  forward as I grow as a developer.
</p>
<p>
  I am enthusiastic about contributing to projects that make a meaningful
  impact, collaborating with diverse teams, and continuously learning in the
  ever-evolving tech landscape. With a solid foundation and a passion for
  problem-solving, I am eager to take on new challenges and contribute as a
  fullstack developer.
